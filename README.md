# Business Understanding
This Project explores safety factors that affect a tech company considering having their own planes and aviation team. 

# Data Understanding
The dataset contains information on aviation crashes and incidents from 1982 through 2022
## Data Preparation  
I removed information on unusual engine and plane types, superfluous data points, and amateur-built planes.
# Exploratory Data Analysis
I looked at correlations between inclement weather and serious injuries, as well as how human error effects aviation accidents and incidents.
# Conclusion
Piston planes seem like a safer option for non-jet engine planes, and human error and weather can both affect safety.

## Limitations
We only have information for incidents and accidents, so there are no comparisons to flights overall. We don't know why piston engines appear safer, and there is less data on other engine types. 
## Recommendations
When it comes to human error, we need to do more research on how to prevent poor decision-making by pilots and other personnel. 
## Next Steps
Research aviation industry training and safetly standards. Learn more about different engine types and how they relate to human error and safety overall.
